# Lab - 02

## About Me

I built an about me page that has some fun interactions so we can learn about the user as well as giving the user some information about myself.

* This went really well! Albeit I had my own struggles today (family distractions), but that's life and I was able to continue on to complete a whole lab.
* I can't wait to touch on what I learned so far in Javascript into the webpages! Up until now, I was just typing code with no real goal. Now that I can see that the goal is actual pretty vast and will be tailored to whatever is required.
* I'm unsure of how long it took, because the distractions pulled me away at some interesting points. What I *completely* missed was writing the **wireframe**! I thought about it right around the tail end, and that would have helped me keep on track with so many distractions.
